# Readme.AI

This file is for AI coding agents contributing to RiskFabric.

## 1. Mission Context

RiskFabric is an asset-first risk management product integrated with EAM.

Core rule: no risk exists without asset linkage.

## 2. Non-Negotiable Constraints

- Product language is English-first.
- Turkish is secondary localization only.
- No Turkish variable, function, class, table, column, enum, or API names.
- Keep architecture API-first and integration-safe.

## 3. Domain Invariants

- Every risk must reference at least one asset.
- Asset hierarchy and dependencies must be preserved.
- Risk propagation is computed impact, not blind risk duplication.
- Integration writes must be idempotent.

## 4. Required References Before Changes

Read these first:

- `docs/project-design.md`
- `docs/eam-asset-configuration-model.md`
- `docs/engineering-standards.md`
- `packages/contracts/beam-web-service-v1.openapi.yaml`
- `docs/integration/beam-plugin-contract.md`

## 5. Technical Direction (Locked)

- Backend: Django + Django REST Framework.
- Python dependency and environment management: Poetry.
- Async jobs: Celery + Redis.
- Database strategy: SQLite for local development, MariaDB for test and production.
- API contract: OpenAPI (schema kept current with implementation).
- Web UI: Django templates + HTMX + Alpine.js + Chart.js.
- Mobile: Flutter client using the same REST APIs.

## 6. Working Rules for AI Agents

- Avoid introducing new terminology when existing domain terms exist.
- Preserve naming consistency with canonical English mappings.
- Add tests with all behavior changes.
- Update docs when assumptions or contracts change.
- Do not add hidden magic behavior in sync logic.

## 7. Suggested Initial Repository Structure

- `apps/backend` - Django project and apps
- `apps/worker` - Celery worker entrypoints
- `apps/web` - Django template/static frontend assets
- `apps/mobile` - Flutter app (future)
- `packages/contracts` - OpenAPI and integration contracts
- `infra` - docker/k8s/terraform templates
- `docs` - architecture, standards, runbooks

## 8. Agent Output Expectations

For each significant change, include:

- brief intent
- changed files
- migration impact
- API contract impact
- rollback notes
