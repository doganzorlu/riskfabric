# Riskfabric User Manual (EN)

This manual teaches enterprise risk management from zero and explains how Riskfabric implements each concept. It follows the menu and is intended to be read like a training book.

## Foundations

### What Is Risk?

Risk is the possibility that an event will affect objectives.
A complete risk statement includes cause, event, and impact.
Example: Because of incomplete access reviews (cause), privileged access misuse (event) could occur, leading to service outage or data loss (impact).
- Risk has uncertainty. If it is certain, it is an issue, not a risk.
- Risk is always tied to objectives and assets.
- Risk is owned by a person or team, not by a system.
- Risk statements should be specific and actionable.

### Risk Analysis

Risk analysis evaluates likelihood and impact to derive a risk level.
It can be qualitative, quantitative, or hybrid.
- Likelihood: probability of the event.
- Impact: severity if the event occurs.
- Existing controls: reduce probability or impact.
- Treatment effectiveness: expected reduction from planned actions.
- Assumptions should be documented.

### Risk Assessment Lifecycle

1. Identify risks on assets and processes.
2. Analyze likelihood and impact using a scoring method.
3. Evaluate risk acceptability against criteria.
4. Treat risks with controls or mitigation plans.
5. Monitor risk status and key indicators.
6. Review periodically and update decisions.

### Vulnerability Management

A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited.
Vulnerability analysis examines exposure, likelihood, and controls for a weakness.
- Vulnerabilities are linked to assets.
- Vulnerabilities can be mapped to risks.
- A vulnerability can exist without a realized incident.
- Vulnerability prioritization should consider asset criticality.

### Governance and Compliance

Governance defines who decides, who approves, and how compliance is monitored.
Compliance proves alignment with standards and regulations.
- Governance programs set policy and oversight.
- Compliance frameworks define requirements.
- Controls and tests provide evidence.


## Risk Management Concepts

### Risk Appetite and Tolerance

Risk appetite describes how much risk the organization is willing to accept.
Risk tolerance defines acceptable variation around objectives.
- Set appetite at leadership level.
- Translate appetite to thresholds in scoring methods.
- Use tolerance to define treatment triggers.

### Risk Categories

- Strategic
- Operational
- Financial
- Compliance
- Technology
- Third-party

### Inherent vs Residual Risk

Inherent risk is the risk before controls.
Residual risk is what remains after controls and treatments.
- Record both when possible.
- Residual risk drives decisions.

- Track KRIs for patch compliance.

Outcome: Patch compliance improved to 90% and risk score decreased.

### Case Study 10: Third-Party Logistics Outage

Context: Logistics provider outage caused shipment delays and revenue impact.

Actions:
- Add third-party asset and dependency mapping.
- Create risk and score impact based on revenue loss.
- Define treatment: secondary provider onboarding.
- Document governance approvals and contracts.

Outcome: Supplier diversification reduced impact and improved resilience.

### Case Study 11: Data Center Power Instability

Context: Power fluctuations increased failure rate for storage arrays.

Actions:
- Log asset and dependency on power systems.
- Create risk and link to incident evidence.
- Add treatment: UPS upgrade and monitoring.
- Schedule monthly reviews until stabilization.

Outcome: Incident frequency dropped and residual risk accepted.

### Case Study 12: Identity Phishing Campaign

Context: Multiple users reported suspicious emails targeting MFA tokens.

Actions:
- Open vulnerability record for phishing exposure.
- Update risk scoring due to increased likelihood.
- Add treatment: phishing simulation and awareness training.
- Track KRI: phishing click rate.

Outcome: Click rate reduced by 60% and risk lowered.

### Case Study 13: Compliance Gap in ISO 27001 Control

Context: Audit found incomplete evidence for access logging control.

Actions:
- Map control requirement to compliance framework.
- Create control test plan and run.
- Capture missing evidence and remediation steps.
- Schedule retest within 30 days.

Outcome: Control passed on retest with documented evidence.

### Case Study 14: Cloud Cost Overrun

Context: Unexpected cloud spend exceeded budget by 30%.

Actions:
- Register cloud platform as asset.
- Create financial risk with likelihood based on trend.
- Define treatment: cost guardrails and alerts.
- Set monthly review and KPI reporting.

Outcome: Spend stabilized within budget in two months.

### Case Study 15: ERP Access Review Failure

Context: Quarterly access reviews for ERP were delayed, and privileged accounts accumulated.

Actions:
- Map ERP as a critical asset and list dependencies.
- Create a risk with cause-event-impact statement.
- Score likelihood using review delay evidence.
- Add treatment: automated access reviews and approvals.
- Set review cadence to quarterly with audit evidence.

Outcome: Residual risk reduced; compliance audit passed with evidence.

### Case Study 16: Unpatched OT Systems

Context: Production floor PLCs missed critical patches due to downtime constraints.

Actions:
- Register OT assets with location metadata.
- Create vulnerability entries for missing patches.
- Link vulnerabilities to operational risk.
- Plan maintenance windows as treatment.
- Track KRIs for patch compliance.

Outcome: Patch compliance improved to 90% and risk score decreased.
